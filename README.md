# Git Analysis Template

## Purpose
This will provide the various templates needed to properly structure analysis of topics and projects via GitHub in a non-directional manner.

## Definitions
**Non-directional Manner:** For the purposes of this template, this means that it allows exploration of topics and projects in as many directions and dimensions as the project members find interesting.
**REF:** Reference code to ease navigation. For example, by typing in [ST001] in the browser's search function, it should bring you to the first subtopic. Each reference code should have exactly two instances in each document: One in the Table of Contents, and one next to the text/area being referenced. Try to maintain consistency with reference codes.

## Notes
Items in [brackets] are meant to be replaced. Items not in brackets can be replaced, but only if truly necessary.
